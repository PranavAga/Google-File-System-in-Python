# Google File System (GFS) Implementation in Python

This project is a simplified implementation of the Google File System (GFS) using Python and gRPC. It is designed to provide a basic understanding of how GFS operates, featuring a master server, multiple chunk servers, and an interactive client.

## Overview

The Google File System is a scalable, distributed file system developed by Google to handle large data sets across many machines. This implementation captures the core concepts of GFS, including:

- **Master Server**: Manages metadata and coordinates access to files.
- **Chunk Servers**: Store file data in chunks and handle read/write operations.
- **Client**: Provides an interactive interface for users to perform file operations.

## Features

- **File Operations**: Create, read, write, and delete files.
- **Chunk Management**: Files are divided into fixed-size chunks for storage.
- **Interactive Client**: Command-line interface for interacting with the file system.

## Architecture

1. **Master Server**: 
   - Maintains metadata about files and chunks.
   - Handles client requests for locating files and chunks.
   - Distributes leases to chunk servers for write operations.

2. **Chunk Server**:
   - Stores file data in chunks.
   - Communicates with the master and clients for data operations.

3. **Client**:
   - Connects to the master server to locate chunks.
   - Interacts with chunk servers to read and write data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- gRPC and Protocol Buffers

### Installation
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install grpcio grpcio-tools
   ```

2. Compile the Protocol Buffers:
   ```bash
   python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. gfs.proto
   ```

### Running the System

1. Start the Master Server:
   ```bash
   python master_server.py
   ```

2. Start one or more Chunk Servers:
   ```bash
   python chunk_server.py
   ```

3. Run the Client:
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

### Using the Client

The client provides an interactive command-line interface. You can perform the following operations:

- **Create a File**: `create`
- **Read a File**: `read`
- **Write to a File**: `write`
- **Delete a File**: `delete`

## Future Work

- Implement additional GFS features such as snapshots and checksums.
- Enhance the client interface for better usability.
- Improve fault tolerance and scalability.
